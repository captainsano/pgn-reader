Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 g6 6. Nc2 d6 7. e4 {With
this, the opening transposes into the Accelerated Dragon, except that
White's pawn has gone to c4.} Bg7 8. Be2 Nd7 9. Bd2 O-O 10. O-O Nc5 11.
b4 Bxc3 {The obvious drawback to capturing on c3 and then e4 is that it
leaves the black squares on the kingside vulnerable to White's dark-squared
bishop.} 12. Bxc3 Nxe4 13. Bb2 f5 (13... Be6 {is the most frequently tried,
though not with any great success.}) 14. Kh1 a5 ({Black might try to impede
the range of the b2 bishop with} 14... e5 {but} 15. f3 Nf6 16. b5 Na5
17. Ba3 {transfers the pressure to the a3-f8 diogonal and the weak pawn
on d6, so White has compenasation for the pawn.}) 15. b5 Ne5 16. Qd4 Nf6
17. f4 Nf7 18. Rad1 Qc7 19. Qf2 e5 20. Qh4 Ne4 21. Ne3 {Diagram [#]} g5
$6 {It is perhaps surprising that Black didn't think to preface this advance
with} (21... Be6 {when White can continue with} 22. Bd3 {and the position
looks to offer chances to both players.}) 22. fxg5 Nfxg5 23. Nd5 Qd8 (23...
Qg7 {looks more solid.}) 24. Bd3 Re8 (24... Nc5 {again runs into} 25.
Nb6 $1 {and all the tactics work out in White's favour.}) 25. c5 $1 Nxc5
26. Bxf5 Bxf5 27. Rxf5 Nge4 28. Qg4+ Kh8 29. Rdf1 Re6 30. Qh3 Qg8 {Diagram
[#] In desperation, Black decides that an exchange sacrifice might be
worth trying, to eliminate White's strong knight.} 31. Nc7 Rae8 32. Nxe8
Rxe8 33. Qh4 Qg6 34. Rf8+ Rxf8 35. Rxf8+ Kg7 36. Qe7+ Kh6 37. Qh4+ Kg7

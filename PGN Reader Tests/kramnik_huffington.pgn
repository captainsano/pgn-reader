1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Be3
{This line almost forces the queen exchange. The queenless middle game
can be still dangerous for black.} c5 8. Rc1 Qa5 9. Qd2 cxd4 10. cxd4
Qxd2+ 11. Bxd2 {A flexible choice, giving white the possibilitity to castle
short.} O-O 12. Nf3 e6 {The current fashion. After the previously popular
12...Bg4 white usually ends up playing an endgame with a bishop pair.
And Kramnik likes that.} (12... Bg4) 13. Bb5 $5 {An annoying move, preventing
smooth development. Kramnik is also playing the percentages. The bishop
move has over 70 percent rate of success. Areshchenko was probably expecting
the more modest 13.Bc4, played by Kramnik against Fabiano Caruana in Dortmund,
Germany, just before the World Cup. Kramnik won in 76 moves, but not because
of his opening play.} Nc6 14. Be3 ({Kramnik does a little tweaking, waiting
before he takes on c6. In his game against Mamedyarov, Moscow 2010, he
chose} 14. Bxc6 bxc6 15. O-O {, but black was able to activate his light
bishop with} Ba6 16. Rfe1 Bb5) 14... Rd8 (14... Bd7) 15. Bxc6 bxc6 16.
Ne5 $5 $146 {A novelty, recommended by a few computer engines.} (16. O-O)
16... Bb7 17. f3 {Preventing 17...c5 and creating a hiding place for his
king on f2. This is a new concept. White doesn't take the pawn on c6.}
Bxe5 $2 {The bishops of opposite colors do not guarantee equality. Black√¢
[]s position has too many holes.} ({Interesting play may occur after}
17... Rac8 18. Nd3 Bxd4 19. Bxd4 Rxd4 20. Nc5 Ba8 21. Ke2 Rcd8 22. Rhd1
{white has a dominating knight. The extra c-pawn burries the bad bishop
and brings more suffering than joy. Aaron Nimzowitsch, the author of My
System and The Blockade, would have been delighted to have this position
with the white pieces.}) 18. dxe5 Rd3 {Black does not have time to repair
the dark square weaknesses with 18...Kg7 and 19...h6.} ({After} 18...
Kg7 19. Bg5 Rd4 20. Kf2 h6 21. Bf6+ Kf8 22. Rhd1 {white dominates on the
black squares.}) ({Giving up a pawn for freedom does not work: after}
18... c5 19. Rxc5 Rac8 20. Rxc8 Rxc8 21. Bh6 {the black king is locked
in and white has a dangerous initiative, for example} Rc5 22. Kf2 Rxe5
$2 23. Rd1 {and white wins.}) 19. Kf2 Rad8 20. Bg5 R8d7 21. h4 {Kramnik's
favorite advance in the Grunfeld, trying to open the h-file. He played
it in many forms and shapes.} h5 22. Kg3 Kh7 23. Rc2 c5 24. Rxc5 Bxe4
{The exchange of pawns allows the white rook to enter the eighth rank,
creating mating threats.} 25. Rc8 Bb7 26. Rf8 {Black has to do something
against the threat 27.Bf6.} f5 ({Forced. After} 26... Kg7 27. Re8 f5 28.
exf6+ Kf7 29. Rh8 {wins.}) 27. exf6 {Kramnik has a strong advanced passed
pawn and black king is still unsafe. No doubts, white can force a win.}
e5 28. Re8 e4 29. Rb1 $1 {Preparing a nice tactical finish.} exf3 30.
Rxb7 $1 fxg2+ 31. Kxg2 (31. Kxg2 Rxb7 32. Re7+ Rxe7 33. fxe7 {white queens.})
1-0
